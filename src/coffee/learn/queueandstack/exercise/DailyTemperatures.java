     * Process indices i in descending order.
     * We'll keep a stack of indices such that T[stack[-1]] < T[stack[-2]] < ...,
     * where stack[-1] is the top of the stack, stack[-2] is second from the top,
     * and so on; and where stack[-1] > stack[-2] > ...; and we will maintain this
     * invariant as we process each temperature.
     *
     * After, it is easy to know the next occurrence of a warmer temperature:
     * it's simply the top index in the stack.
     *
     * Here is a worked example of the contents of the stack as we work through
     * T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73] in reverse order, at the end of the
     * loop (after we add T[i]). For clarity, stack only contains indices i, but
     * we will write the value of T[i] beside it in brackets, such as 0 (73).
     *
     * When i = 7, stack = [7 (73)]. ans[i] = 0.
     * When i = 6, stack = [6 (76)]. ans[i] = 0.
     * When i = 5, stack = [5 (72), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 1.
     * When i = 4, stack = [4 (69), 5 (72), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 1.
     * When i = 3, stack = [3 (71), 5 (72), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 2.
     * When i = 2, stack = [2 (75), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 4.
     * When i = 1, stack = [1 (74), 2 (75), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 1.
     * When i = 0, stack = [0 (73), 1 (74), 2 (75), 6 (76)]. ans[i] = 1.
     *
     * @param T temperature
     * @return the days have to wait until a warmer temperature
