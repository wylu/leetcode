 * Likes:    4911
 * Dislikes: 216
 * Total Accepted:    850.1K
 * Total Submissions: 1.7M
 * Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given
 * stock on day i.
 * 
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy
 * one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the
 * maximum profit.
 * 
 * Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit
 * = 6-1 = 5.
 * Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
